## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a Vunerabilaty just make a new issue and tell what vunerability, do you think there is, currently there is no Vunerabilaty and the Software is safe to use,
I have personally checked every line of code, it is all good, but if you think that there could be one be sure to tell me.
